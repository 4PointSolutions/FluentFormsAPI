# AEM Forms Fluent API Examples

This sub-project provides examples of using the Fluent Forms API for AEM Forms-based applications.

## Goals of this sub-project

This maven sub-project provides examples of how to call the fluentforms API.

In the short term, it provides samples that compile (and should work if run).

In the longer term, we expect to create a bundle that can be deployed and executed on the server (in order to ensure that the samples are actually correct and produce the expected results on the server).
